Riddle Website by Vanessa Camilli for IS 3020 Final Project

#Project Guidelines
#Create a Riddle Website 

*Build a web application game that asks players to guess the answer to specific text riddles in order to create a final code
*The player is presented a text riddle and a textarea in which to submit their answer
*If the player answers correctly their answer is printed and they move on to the next riddle
*If they player answers incorrectly their answer is stored and printed and the textarea is cleared so they can guess again
*When the final riddle is displayed the player will input the final code but will be redirected to another webpage if the answer is correct
*The second page will read "Hello World" and play a song as a reward
*If the answer is incorrect then the text area will be cleared for them to guess again
